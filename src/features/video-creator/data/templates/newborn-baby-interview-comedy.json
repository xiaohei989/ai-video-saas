  "promptTemplate": "A creative and funny short video, simulating the contrasting comedic scene of a newborn baby being interviewed and 'talking.' Hospital ward setting with white bed and pillows, large windows letting in natural light, creating a bright and warm medical environment. A newborn, wrapped in a white towel, sitting on the bed, looking confused. An adult woman interviewer, wearing a blue suit, holding a microphone with 'BABYME' printed on it, leaning in with a smile and asking: 'Welcome to the new world, you're the new member of our family. What do you want to say?' The baby responds: '{baby_response}' Camera work includes slice switching (close-up of baby and microphone → mid-shot interactive panorama → close-up of baby), with natural camera movement, reminiscent of a news interview. Realistic, textured look with bright colors, natural lighting, natural movement, and a lighthearted comedic atmosphere. No subtitles.",
