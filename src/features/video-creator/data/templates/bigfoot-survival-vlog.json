  "promptTemplate": "POV selfie of a realistic male Bigfoot in {weather_condition} conditions during {time_of_day}, holding a selfie stick with the camera at the end, and a GoPro mounted on forehead. {activity_description} The scene unfolds in a pristine wilderness setting with towering pine trees and ancient oaks forming a natural canopy overhead. Dappled sunlight filters through the dense foliage, creating dramatic light and shadow patterns on the forest floor covered with fallen leaves and moss-covered rocks. In the background, distant mountains rise majestically while a gentle breeze rustles through the branches. The air is crisp and clean, filled with the earthy scents of the wild forest. Natural sounds of chirping birds and rustling wildlife provide an authentic wilderness atmosphere. National Geographic style, HD quality with cinematic depth of field.
