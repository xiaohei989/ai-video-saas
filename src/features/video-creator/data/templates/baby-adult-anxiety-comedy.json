  "promptTemplate": "A cinematic long take, an extreme close-up shot. The focus is on a sunlit nursery where a baby, around one year old, looks deeply sad and worried. The background features a cream-colored carpet and a baby crib, beautifully blurred to create a stunning depth of field with excellent bokeh. The camera captures a continuous action: First, the baby lifts his head, his eyes welling with tears, his expression filled with profound sorrow. He lets out a heavy, world-weary sigh, facing the camera directly. (The frame is a tight single shot on the baby; no one else appears). At this moment, a gentle, adult female voice asks from off-screen in {response_language}: '{interview_question}' Then, a black microphone enters the frame, moving into position right in front of the baby. The baby replies in a desperate, childish voice in {response_language}: '{baby_answer}' Both the interviewer and baby speak clearly in {response_language} language with appropriate accents and pronunciation.",
